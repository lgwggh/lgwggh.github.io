    <h2>Current Life</h2>
    <p>My Name is Lily Weirich, and I am a junior here at The University of Missouri. I am majoring in Psychology with an emphasis in Human Resources and Hospitality Managament. I grew up in a small town in Southern Illinois called Alton, which is where most of my family lives. I currently stay in an apartment with my four close friends, and my fifth roommate, my Bunny, Beans!

    <h3>Is having a rabbit easy?</h3>
    <p>The simple answer is, no. However, if you possess the time and dedication to provide constant care for your bunny, you wil see success. It was a long process raising Beans from when he was just a small rabbit, but if you do your reasearch, and do it right, you shoudl raise a happy, healthy, and freindly rabbit!</p>
